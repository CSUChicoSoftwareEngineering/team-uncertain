Purpose: Our goal for this semester is designing and developing an Android application. The ideas for this project cover a wide range of applications, but we've narrowed it down to four:
                1. A security application to give the user more control over their privacy
                2. A group-finding social app that allows users to map events AND/OR find study groups
                3. An interactive, in-depth, and involved tutorial to help teach new users how to code
                4. An Android game app.
    We have many different directions we want to take this but, as we research and work together, we'll refine our idea and get it set in stone.
